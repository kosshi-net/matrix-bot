## Command targets

Commands can often take multiple rooms and users, and perform actions in bulk. For example: 
```
!kick #alpha #bravo @foo @bar
```
This will kick all the listed `@users` from all the listed `#rooms`.

The order at which rooms, users, or even arguments are listed, do not generally matter.

```!level @foo #bravo 1``` is equal to ```!level #bravo 1 @foo```. Both will set the power level of `@foo` in room `#bravo` to `1`.

If room is optional but none is specified, the action is performed on the room 
where the command was issued. Same is true with users, commands with optional 
user targets will run on the user issuing the command, if none was given.

Note: the `:domain.org` is omitted from IDs in these examples, but is required in practice.
